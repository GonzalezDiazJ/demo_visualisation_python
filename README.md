This notebook was used to demo some plotting libraries in my [PyConAU 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3Yk7a2qYI).

Depending on what version of Jupyter you're running, you may need to launch this notebook with a higher data rate limit so that visualisation libraries are not throttled in communicating with the browser, e.g.

```jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000```
